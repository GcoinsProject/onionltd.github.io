        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>OnionTree is a repository of Tor hidden services. We aim to provide up-to-date, curated index of the most
            popular dark web services, and be as transparent about it as technology allows it.</p>

        <p>We want access to the data to be easy for humans and machines alike. All data is stored in <em>YAML</em> files.
            <em>YAML</em> can be easily
            read and written by both. The data is also available in <em>JSON</em> via <a href="./api.html">API</a>.</p>

        <p>We want access to the data to remain unrestricted, that's why it's released in public domain. Other
            works,
            such as software, is available as a free software (free as in freedom). We hope that access to open data and
            free software will fuel novel ideas.</p>

        <p>This website is <a href="https://github.com/onionltd/oniontree-html-generator">generated</a> from data in the
            repository and is served by a web server. Use only the mirrors listed in <a href="/mirrors.txt">/mirrors.txt</a>.
            All other websites claiming to be OnionTree are fake.</p>

        <h2>How it works?</h2>

        <p>New data is discovered by manually traversing
            <a href="./services/darknetlive.html">Darknet Live</a>,
            <a href="./services/dread.html">Dread</a>,
            <a href="./services/darkfail.html">dark.fail</a>
            and dark web <a href="./tags/forum.html">forums</a>, or by
            user submitted contributions via <a href="https://github.com/onionltd/oniontree">GitHub</a>. All contributions
            are recorded in a <em>Git</em> repository and must be <em>PGP</em> signed. Entire
            history of a file since its introduction into the repository is preserved.</p>

        <p>Services which support <a href="https://github.com/onionltd/go-omg/blob/master/spec.txt">Onion Mirror Guidelines</a>
            are <a href="https://github.com/onionltd/oniontree-omg-tools">updated</a> automatically.</p>

        <p><a href="./tags/securedrop.html">SecureDrop</a> instances are <a href="https://github.com/onionltd/securedrop-api-scraper">scraped</a> from
            official SecureDrop directory API.</p>
